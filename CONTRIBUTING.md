# Controbuting to Descriptor OS

---

We at OpenStudio love gathering together and creating great things,
and we hope you do too!

however, when contributing to Descriptor OS, some things have to be kept in mind.

most notibly that this Operating system is meant to "in the near future", Install to a computer as a development version of a daily driver.

nothing you see here is allways going to work first time, and if it does, ether you followed the tutorial correct or you just got cursed. please don't be affraid."unless it's the cuse. then run and call a witch doctor"

When creating a pull request to fix a problem in the operating system, please follow these rules.

1. give the pull request a good title explaining the fix in a small sentience.
2. with the description, provide with or without detail, what was wrong and how you managed to fix it.
3. provide the required tags depending on what the issue is.
